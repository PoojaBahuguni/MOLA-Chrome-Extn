  3. /api/sentiment-score

Adding a chrome extension

  Please follow the instructions https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked to load the extension. Please choose "ChromeExtension" from the github while selecting the chrome extension directory. This should add an extension to your chrome with USC logo. On going to a twitter page and and clicking on the extension icon should display a "Detected Mode" tag for every tweet.
  
Limitations

  The chrome extensions might not work as the GCP hhtps is not working because. Requesting a http from secured Twitter website is giving a Mixed COntent Error
